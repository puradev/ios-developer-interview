# Plan of Attack

This is the scope of the work I'm hoping to accomplish.

~~1. Resolve errors for fetching~~

> So nothing was wrong, on my initial test, after viewing docs, the request can only have a single word. But this is a solid improvment we can add

- Add extensions for JSON Printing for utility & debugging
- Add Logging to requests

2. Update networking to use Async/Await

- Use `Codable` and generics to handle JSON parsing rather than manual methods

3. Utilize SwiftUI and TCA

- TCA for state management of our feature
- SwiftUI for the views
- Dependency injection and will follow PF Dependency lib

4. Add App Icon

- Cause let's give the little guy some love

5. Tab View

- Tabs for Dictionary/Thesaurus

6. Swipe action to "Favorite" a word

- I think we can get here
- If time allows, add some kind of caching or save locally? SwiftData?
