# Etymo

Explore words like never before with definitions, origins, usage, and more in one powerful app.

## Development

Open `Etymo.xcodeproj` and build/run the project.

### Images

Convert all icons to [symbols](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/uiimage/creating_custom_symbol_images_for_your_app) and store them in `Assets.xcassets/Symbols`. Export symbols from [SF Symbols](https://developer.apple.com/sf-symbols/) or use [SF Symbol Creator](https://www.figma.com/community/plugin/1207724751253683840) to export custom icons from Figma.

Use compiled assets instead of string named images:

```
// Incorrect
Image("star")

// Correct
Image(.star)
```
